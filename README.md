# AuroraQuest

[Youtube Demo Here](LINKS TO YOUTUBE)
An RPG dungeon game wherein the player has to enconter and fight monsters who are guarding chests, and gain loot in ERC-20 DGN (in-game) token (Dungeon Token).

The player has to finally unlock the locked gates by seeking the keys to the token-gate who is locked inside a wall in the dungeon and ultimately defeat the the evil angel who possesses the ultimate key to the Aurora NFT.
Once the user collect the Aurora NFT collectible, an NFT is minted to your NFT-Trophy Gallery. These NFTs are verifiably provable and powered by random number generators, which gives them random attributes on-chain.

# Plans for the future
- To have an in-game DEX, to allow users to swap other tokens on Aurora to DGN token
- In game marketplace to allow users to buy and sell NFT characters and game potions and equip the same in further levels.
- 1v1 gameplay between two warriors by staking tokens and fighting for the stake
- Ability to craft Rare NFTs, by on-chain XP, that is attained while playing the levels.
- Genesis NFT minting event through a mystery box sale, based on character rarity.
